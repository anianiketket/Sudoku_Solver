README ABOUT UPDATES
------------------------------------------
A menu has been incorporated to grid setting stage before performing OCR which enables to customize the ROI space using UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT buttons. Straightening the image has also been applied for correction of rotated images w.r.t. to horizon.
The major problem with OCR is the ROI might include small parts of other elements and bug the output matrix. It is sensitive to flaws.

I will keep looking for better image processing techniques and develop this button interface with a mouse drag and drop if possible.
